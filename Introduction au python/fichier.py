    Note that all docstrings begin with a one-line summary. The summary is

    etc) and ends with a period. The method signature is not, in any way,
    duplicated into the comments (that would be difficult to maintain).
    All subsequent paragraphs in a docstring are indented exactly the same as
    the summary line. The same applies to the closing quotation marks.
